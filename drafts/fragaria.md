# Overview

Two species, the North American endemic *Fragaria virginiana* Miller,
and the circumboreal *F. vesca* L. 

# *Fragaria virginiana* Miller

*Fragaria virginiana* is an octoploid, and one of the parents (along with
the western North American octoploid *F. chiloensis*) of the cultivated
strawberry, *F. x ananassa*. The cross that resulted in *F. x ananassa*
occurred in Europe, not in the wild, although both species co-occur in
western North America and do sometimes hybridize on their own.

[FNA (Staudt)](http://floranorthamerica.org/Fragaria) recognizes four
subspecies of *F. virginiana*, but numerous morphological and genetic
investigations have failed to corroborate them [@HokansonEtAl_2007].
@GleasonCronquist_1991 was skeptical of the subspecies, and they are not
included in the [Michigan
Flora](https://michiganflora.net/genus.aspx?id=Fragaria).

# *Fragaria vesca* L.

A circumboreal diploid species, four subspecies in North America (and
globally), two in eastern North America. The native *Fragaria vesca* subsp.
*americana* (Porter) Staudt is native in eastern North America *Fragaria
vesca* subsp. *vesca* is Eurasian, occasionally naturalized here.

## Identification

Following [Michigan
Flora](https://michiganflora.net/genus.aspx?id=Fragaria): 

*F. virginiana*: terminal tooth of the central leaflet shorter and narrower
than the two adjacent teeth, often much smaller; fruit round, achenes
sunken into the surface; calyx lobes appressed to the developing fruit;
hairs on petioles strongly spreading. Flowers tend to be larger, at least
on bisexual flowers: petals up to 12 mm long, flower diameter up to 26 mm. 

*F. vesca*: terminal tooth of the central leaflet as long or longer than
the two adjacent teeth and equally wide; fruit conical, achenes sitting
proud on the surface; calyx lobes spreading to reflexed on developing
fruit; hairs on petioles strongly spreading. Flowers smaller, diameter less
than 15 mm (at least in subsp. *americana*).

[FNA (Staudt)](http://floranorthamerica.org/Fragaria) distinguishes *F.
vesca* subsp. *vesca* from *F. vesca* subsp. *americana* based on the shape
of the torus (fruit receptacle): subsp. *vesca* is globose/subglobose,
while subsp. *americana* is conical. Confusingly, *F. virginiana* closely
matches *F. vesca* subsp *vesca* for these traits.

From the [Michigan Flora](https://michiganflora.net/species.aspx?id=2483):

> Flowering specimens, especially, of *F. virginiana* and *F. vesca* are
> not always easy to separate. The mature leaflets in *F. virginiana* are Â±
> dark or bluish green when fresh and (especially the terminal one) usually
> distinctly petiolulate; the peduncle at maturity is generally shorter
> than the longest petioles; the flowers tend to be larger (petals up to 12
> mm long). In *F. vesca* the leaflets are a brighter green and sessile;
> the peduncle at maturity usually exceeds even the longest petioles; and
> the petals are less than 7 mm long (often as short as 4 mm or even
> smaller, but in *F. virginiana* they may also be less than 7 mm). After
> the petals have fallen, the attitude of the calyx lobes seems to be as
> dependable a character as any for distinguishing the species.
