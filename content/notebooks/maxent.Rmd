## Sampling Bias

Sampling bias in occurrence data is an issue because it means we can't be
sure a species is detected under certain conditions because that's it's
preferred habitat, or because those are the conditions in the locations we
prefer to search.

"The uniform sampling assumption does not require a uniformly random sample
from geographic space, but instead that environmental conditions are
sampled in proportion to their availability, regardless of their spatial
pattern" [@merow.etal_2013].

This problem can be addressed by thinning records (also called spatial
filtering, @radosavljevic.anderson_2014), such that multiple records from
within the same area are represented by only one or a few of the total
records. This is a bit crude, but should remove the worst biases, such as a
particular field station getting preferentially sampled by recurring visits
from scientists or students, or general biases towards sampling roadsides
and popular trails.

@lee-yaw.etal_2018 developed their own method to thin species records,
using kernel smoothing estimates to reduce the number of samples from a
neighbourhood, and selecting which samples to keep via novel environments.
I don't think this is widespread, and feels a bit like overkill.

Subsampling based on raster grids is a simpler, more intuitive approach
provided by @hijmans.etal_2017. It doesn't account for the possibility
that local density may be an accurate reflection of the niche requirements
of a species, as the approach of @lee-yaw.etal_2018 does. 

Grid-sampling:
```{R, eval = FALSE}
### create an empty raster
r <- raster::raster(trich) 
###  set the resolution:
###   to match the environmental layers
res(r) <- res(env)

###   to set to one minute, ca 2km square
res(r) <- 1/60 

###   double the environmental layer
res(r) <- 2 * res(env) 

### extend it outwards one cell to avoid edges 
r <- extend(r, extent(r) + 1) 

### sample one point per cell:
trichsel <- gridSample(trich, r, n = 1) 
```

@aiello-lammens.etal_2015 provides an alternative approach based on
imposing a minimum permissible nearest-neighbour distance, and then finding
the set that retains the most samples through repeated random samples.

Thinning by Nearest-Neighbour:
```{R Thinning by Nearest-Neighbour, eval = FALSE}
## thin.par sets minimum distance in km
trichthin <- thin(data.frame(LAT = coordinates(trich)[, "Y"],
                             LONG = coordinates(trich)[, "X"],
                             SPEC = rep("tplan", nrow(trich))),
                  thin.par = 2, reps = 1, write.files = FALSE,
                  locs.thinned.list.return = TRUE) 
```

@radosavljevic.anderson_2014 show that unfiltered/unthinned data produces
elevated assessment of model performance, as a consequence of over-fitting
to spatially auto-correlated data. So filtering works.

See also Boria et al. 2014, Varela et al. 2014 (unread)

@merow.etal_2013 provide two more rigorous approaches, depending on
whether or not data on search effort is available. When search effort is
known, it can be used to construct a biased prior.

When search effort is unknown, we can create a biased background sample to
account for bias in presence data, via Target Group Sampling. Under TGS,
records that are collected using the same surveys/methods as the focal
species are form the background points. i.e., the set of all herbarium
records in GBIF may be an appropriately biased background for any one of
those plant species. This assumes that the target plant is
collected/detected at the same rate as the reference set. It may be
appropriate to subset the reference set to increase the likelihood of this
being true: use only graminoids as biased background for sedges, or woody
plants as background for a tree?

## Study Extent
Discussed extensively in @barve.etal_2011. They identified three general
approaches to consider:

1. Biotic regions (ecozones etc). A good compromise between biological
   realism and tractability
2. Niche-model reconstructions: back-project a niche model over the
   appropriate time period (i.e., previous glacial maximum or interglacial)
   to identify the area that the species could have occupied over an
   extended period. Nice idea, but a real risk of circularity?
3. Detailed simulations. Sounds great, but I think if we had enough data to
   properly parameterize such a model, we wouldn't need to resort to sdms
   in the first place.

If you wanted to improve on biotic regions, things to consider in
developing a more rigorous approach should include:

1. Dispersal characteristics of the species
2. Crude estimate of the niche (again, circularity?)
3. Establish relevant time span
4. Identify relevant environmental changes

@soberon_2010 is often cited together with @barve.etal_2011, but the latter
provides more explicit discussion of best practices for sdm model
construction. I think the deference to Soberon is probably due to their
creation of the BAM model (in earlier publications), which Barve's system
is based on (Biotic, Abiotic, Movement).

@merow.etal_2013 provide a shorter discussion, and emphasize matching the
study extent to the biological question of interest. Prioritizing sites for
protection within the range of a species should constrain the extent to the
existing range of the species; evaluating invasion potential should use an
extent large enough to encompass the areas of concern (i.e., global, or
continental scale for novel invasives).

## Variable Selection
Variables == predictors, the spatial layers used as the environmental/dependent variables in the model.

Interesting discussion in @guisan.etal_2017 (section 6.4, page 102+):
variables that are measured most accurately often/usually are only
indirectly related to a species' niche; e.g., elevation, slope, aspect.
Very precise and accurate spatial layers are available for these. 

Variables with a direct relationship to a species niche are usually created
through interpolation from sparse reference points (weather stations), and
this involves unavoidable error propagation and imprecision.
 
Over small extents, it may be preferable to use indirect variables, as they
offer greater precision in quantifying the local environment. However, as
extent increases, the relative value of direct variables increases. The
indirect variables are likely not stationary on large scales - a species
relationship to slope and elevation are likely different in southern US vs
northern Canada, for instance. On the other hand, a species relationship to
temperature, however coarsely it is mapped, is likely similar across its
geographic range.

@merow.etal_2013 identify two general approaches to selecting variables.
The machine learning approach is based on the understanding that the
Maxent algorithm will, by design, select the most useful variables and
features, so we can include all reasonable variables.

However, this probably only applies when the objective is to provide
accurate predictions of occurrences in the same context in which the model
is built. Efforts to understand the environmental constraints on that
distribution, or projecting it to a new context, will be potentially
confounded when the model includes correlated variables.

To minimize this problem, @merow.etal_2013 recommends taking a statistical
approach (i.e., treating a Maxent model as a 'conventional' statistical
model). In this case, they recommend prescreening variables to limit
colinearity, and emphasize biologically relevant variables. This should
produce more parsimonious and interpretable models.

Pairwise correlations can be used to identify pairs or groups of variables
that are highly correlated. ENMTools [@warren.etal_2019] provides several
helper functions for this, including `raster.cor.matrix`,
`raster.cor.plot`. I prefer using `hclust` based on `1 - abs(cor)` to
visualize correlated groups.

However, this won't address multicollinearity among three or more
variables. @guisan.etal_2017 suggest using the function `usdm::vif`
instead, which calculates variable inflation. They recommend keeping the
vif values under 10, but different authors will use cutoffs from 5-20.

@petitpierre.etal_2017 explicitly tested different approaches to model
selection for use in projecting models in space and time. Their results
support Merow's statistical approach: modelers should use a small number of
'proximal' variables (i.e., variables known to be biologically relevant to
the species in question), or the first few PCA axes of a larger set of
environmental variables. PCA axes are orthogonal (i.e., not collinear) by
construction, but interpretation may be tricky if they incorporate a large
number of variables. 

## Feature Selection
Features == the statistical models used to fit the variables to the
response variables (presences). i.e., linear, quadratic, product, hinge,
threshold, categorical.

@merow.etal_2013 recommend selecting features on biological grounds. They
provide a short discussion, noting that the fundamental niche is likely
quadratic for most variables over a large enough extent, but may be better
approximated by a linear function if the study extent is truncated with
respect to the species' tolerance for that variable (ala Whittaker).
Interesting ideas, but not much to go on unless you actually do know a fair
bit about your species.

@warren.seifert_2011 describe a process for selecting features to
keep/include in the model (linear, quadratic, polynomial, hinge, threshold,
categorical). It uses the AIC to identify the optimal combination. Easy and
quick to do with the ENMEval package (note that many references cite
ENMTools for these tests, but they've been moved to ENMEval nowadays).

**NB** applying different spatial filtering/thinning to your data can produce different 'optimal' models (i.e., different retained features and regularization value), as determined by the AIC criterion. 
## Regularization
Regularization is used to penalize complexity. Low values will produce
models with many predictors and features, with 0 leading to all features
and variables being included. This can lead to problems with over-fitting
and interpretation. Higher regularization values will lead to 'smoother',
and hopefully more general and transferable models. There will be a
trade-off between over- and under-fitting. 

The default values in Maxent are based on empirical tests on a large number
of species. These are probably not unreasonable, but it's pretty standard
to mention that they're a compromise, and we improved them for our the
needs of our particular species and context by doing X (for various values
of X).

The approach of @warren.seifert_2011 (see previous) can be used here as
well, testing a range of regularization (aka beta) values, and selecting
the one that generates the lowest AIC. It may also be worth selecting the
simplest model that is within a certain similarity of the 'best' model?
That's more to explain to reviewers though.

Warren and Seifert's simulations demonstrate that models with
a similar number of parameters to the true model produce more accurate
models, in terms of suitability, variable assessment, and ranking of
habitat suitability, both for the training extent and for models projected
in space/time. Furthermore, AIC and BIC are the most effective approaches
to model tuning to achieve the correct number of parameters.

@radosavljevic.anderson_2014 also consider the impact of the regularization
parameter on over-fitting. They find that the default value often leads to
over-fitting, especially when spatial auto-correlation is not accounted for
in model fitting. They conclude that regularization should be set
deliberately for a study, following the results of experiments exploring a
range of potential values.

Note that specifying the regularization is done via the `betamultiplier`
argument, which applies to each of the different feature classes. That is,
the actual regularization value will be set by Maxent automatically for
each class, subject to the multiplier value specified by the user. We don't
set the regularization values for each class directly (which is possible
via the options `beta_lqp`, `beta_threshold` etc. [@phillips_2017],
although @radosavljevic.anderson_2014 suggest experiments to explore this
should be done.

## Output type
Raw: values are Relative Occurrence Rate (ROR), which will sum to 1 over
the extent of the study.

Cumulative: the sum of all cells with <= to the raw value of the cell.
Rescaled to range from 0-100.

Logistic: Not sure what this actually means.

@merow.etal_2013 recommends sticking to Raw whenever possible, which means using the
same species in the same extent. Note that the raw values will change for
different extents, even for identical models, so they can't be compared
across projections without additional post-processing.

## Evaluation
### AUC

AUC assesses the success of the model in correctly ranking a random
background point and a random presence point; that is, it should predict
the suitability of the presence point higher than the background point. It
is threshold-independent.

@lobo.etal_2008 identified five problems with AUC:

1) it ignores the predicted probability values and the goodness-of-fit of the model; 
2) it summarises the test performance over regions of the ROC space in
   which one would rarely operate;
3) it weights omission and commission errors equally; 
4) it does not give information about the spatial distribution of model
   errors; and, most importantly,
5) the total extent to which models are carried out highly influences the
   rate of well-predicted absences and the AUC scores.
 
Additionally, @radosavljevic.anderson_2014 point out that AUC doesn't
assess over-fitting or goodness-of-fit; rather, it is a measure of
discrimination capacity. 

However, comparing the difference in AUC for the training and testing data
does give an estimate of overfitting. If the model fit perfectly, without
overfitting, the AUC should be identical. It won't be, and the difference
reflects the degree to which the model is over-fit on the training data. In
other words, the extent to which the model is fit to noise in the data, or
environmental bias, if geographic masking is used in the k-fold partitions. 

### Boyce

@hirzel.etal_2006 evaluated a variety of sdm evaluation measures; on data
sets with more than 50 presences, most evaluators had > 0.70 correlation
with each other. Which is a little reassuring I suppose? They used AUC on
presence/absence data as the 'gold standard', and found that the continuous
Boyce index (which uses presence-only data) performed best.

### Thresholds

@radosavljevic.anderson_2014 Threshold-dependent evaluation requires
identifying a threshold in values predicted by the model to generate a
binary suitable/unsuitable map. Setting the threshold to the lowest
predicted value for a presence location may produce undesireable results if
the lowest values is associated with an observation from an extreme
outlier. More robust is setting the threshold to a particular quantile
(10%), to exclude weirdos from establishing what's suitable.

Again, if the model is perfectly fit, the omission rate in the testing data
should be the same as in the training data. That is, setting the threshold
at 10% to create the binary suitability map, we expect the omission rate in
the test data to be 10%. Higher omission in the testing data reflects
over-fitting (noise and/or bias). 

For presence-only data commission error is unknown/unknowable. Accordingly,
@radosavljevic.anderson_2014 defined an optimal model as one that "(1)
reduced omission rates to the lowest observed value (or near it) and
minimized the difference between calibration and evaluation AUC [i.e.,
minimized over-fitting]; and (2) still led to maximal or near maximal
observed values for the evaluation AUC (which assesses discriminatory
ability). When more than one regularization multiplier fulfilled these
criteria equally well, we chose the lowest one, to promote discriminatory
ability (and hence, counter any tendency towards underfitting)."

### Cross-validation

@radosavljevic.anderson_2014 evaluated cross-validation using random k-fold
partitions, geographical structuring, and geographic masking of partitions.
Random partitions suffer from preserving biases in the training data in the
testing data. 

Geographic structuring, which uses occurrences from a pre-defined
geographic area (rather than a random sample) as the test set, introduces
additional spatial bias, and should be avoided. However, geographic
structuring combined with masking (which excludes both presences and
background from the specified geographic region from the test set) may
substantially reduce overfitting, and yields more realistic models than
random partitions.

Checkerboard partitions offer a nice compromise - this is geographic
structuring and masking on a fine scale, and so should reduce spatial
correlation between training and testing data. A version was used by
@pearson.etal_2013, without a lot of discussion. Functions to do
checkerboard cross validation are provided by @muscarella.etal_2014, but
without a lot of discussion. The cited references suggest this might be
intended more for species with limited occurrence data? Also, as
implemented it looks like they only allow for 2-fold and 4-fold
cross-validation. I'm not sure there's any reason not to use checkerboards
to do 9- or 16- fold cross validation?

## Projection
Complex models, with large numbers of predictors, or that use complex features, are more likely to be overfit. Overfitting sacrifices generality (i.e., capacity to project to different scenarios) in favour of better fit to training data. Consequently, for the purposes of projection, we may want to emphasize smaller, simpler models. See also @petitpierre.etal_2017 for discussion of variable selection.

@guisan.etal_2017: two related issues to consider when comparing the environment in the training region to that in the region into which the model is projected:

- availability:
  are environment 'types' similarly abundant and available?

- analog:
  are the environment 'types' in the projected range also present in the training range?

The act of projection implicitly assumes environments are fully analagous with equal availability.

This is to a large extent unavoidable, so we have to take measures to reduce it in data preparation, and/or account for it in interpretation of results.

### Clamping
Maxent includes the option of "clamping" projections. This constrains the values for environmental values in the projected range to the limit of that variable that is found in the training range. This has the effect of setting the predicted value of all non-analog cells to the value for the most extreme environments that are found in the training region.

This will reduce the occurence of unrealistic patterns emerging from the extension of complex models beyond the range of values they were trained on. It's probably better than not clamping, but no reason to expect it's particularly realistic.

@guisan.etal_2017 doesn't mention clamping at all. Instead, they recommend explicitly identifying non-analog environments and excluding them from the projection; or at least, identifying them clearly and giving them due consideration in the interpretation of the results.

### MESS
Multivariate Environmental Similarity Surfaces, @elith.etal_2010, provide a way to identify non-analog environments, and to quantify the extent to which they differ from environments in the training area. The functions `dismo::mess` and `ecospat::ecospat.mess` can be used to calculate MESS values. MESS is typically applied in geographic space.

### COUE
The ecospat package also provides functions to contrast environmental conditions between training and projection regions in E-space. E-space and G-space provide complementary views of the niche. E-space shows the environmental distribution of a species in the context of all possible environmental combinations; G-space shows the distribution of the species, constrained to environmental conditions that actually exist in the landscape.

`ecospat` provides all the functions necessary to test niche differences in E-space and G-space, in the `COUE` framework (centroid, overlap, underfilling and expansion).
