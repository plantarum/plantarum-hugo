Collecting blackberries and their relatives (*Rubus* spp.) for herbarium
study is particularly challenging, and even experienced field-botanists may
not appreciate everything that is involved. More than in other vascular
plant groups, to make a good *Rubus* specimens, you need to understand a
bit about the their life-cycle.

![A single *Rubus allegheniensis* specimen, with the first-year primocane
on the right, the second-year floricane on the left, and my expert *Rubus*
presser Charlotte in the middle. Note that the primocane is unbranched,
while the floricane has many flowering branches](assets/TWS3673-web.jpg

branches")

Blackberries, and most other *Rubus*, are perennial shrubs. However, their
stems, called canes, are biennial. In the first year of growth a cane
remains in a vegetative state, and does not flower. Usually, it doesn't
even form any side branches. These canes are referred to as **primocanes**.
At the end of the season, buds form in the leaf axils and at the shoot tip.

In the second year of growth, flowering shoots will emerge from these buds.
At this stage, the cane is called a **floricane**. Growth stops after the
fruits are formed; the floricane doesn't produce any over-wintering buds.

A mature blackberry plant produces both primocanes and floricanes at the
same time. The floricanes start earlier in the season, since they get a
head-start building from last year's primocanes. By the time the flowers
appear in June or early July, the next batch of primocanes are only just
beginning to emerge from the underground rhizome.

Unlike other angiosperms, blackberry flowers aren't generally useful
taxonomically[^1]. The really interesting characters are the primocane
leaves, the stem armature (prickles, bristles, hairs and glands) and the
mature inflorescences of the floricane. This means the best time to collect
specimens is later in the season, when the fruits are forming or ripe and
the primocanes are well developed.

[^1]: What I should say here is that flowers have not been found useful by
previous taxonomic research on blackberries. Sadly, previous taxonomic
research on blackberries is quite a mess, and I am prepared to accept
that anything I think I know about this group is completely wrong.

1. First, confirm that you are collecting both a floricane and a primocane,
   and they both come from the same rootstock. This is important, as we've
   seen a lot of mixed populations!

   ![*Rubus* rhizome, confirming the primocane and floricane are part of
   the same plant. The upper cane is the primocane, and the lower one is
   the floricane. Primocanes are usually green, and floricanes usually red.
   This can vary though!](assets/TWS3669-web.jpg "The base of two *Rubus*
   canes, with the soil uncovered, showing that they are indeed part of the
   same plant.")

2. You make at least two separate sheets for each plant. For the first,
   select a representative section of the cane from the central part of the
   primocane, with a few well-formed mature leaves attached. The cane tips
   are easily damaged, and don't generally press well. Similarly, the
   leaves at the base of the cane are often damaged or misshapen.

   Pressing the leaves is tricky, particularly on prickly specimens. Keep
   in mind that on the mounted sheet you will want to see the intact
   outline of a complete leaf, as well as examples of the upper and lower
   surface of the leaves.

   two well-formed leaves, and we're pressing them so that both upper and
   lower surfaces will be visible.](assets/TWS3675-web.jpg "Two *Rubus*
   leaves, connected to the same stem, laid flat in a herbarium press")

3. Make sure the specimen includes a nice segment of the most heavily-armed
   section of the stem. Sometimes the best leaves and the nastiest prickles
   are on different sections of the stem. If this is the case, include a
   section of the prickliest part of the stem, with the leaves removed, in
   your sample.

   ![Include a section of the prickliest part of the cane in your
   collection](assets/TWS3664-web.jpg "A close up of a *Rubus* cane,
   showing the large prickles and glandular hairs.")

4. Use a second sheet, with a separate newsprint folder, for the floricane.
   Get a section of the stem with two or three well-formed inflorescence
   branches. Again, the little shoots at the very top or bottom of the cane
   are often misshapen, so use the center of the cane. As for the
   primocane, make sure you've got a section of the prickliest cane.

   ![Preparing a *Rubus* floricane sheet](assets/TWS3678-web.jpg "A *Rubus*
   cane, showing the flowering branches, laid flat in a herbarium press.")

   Floricane leaves are incredibly variable. If you can include a few
   well-formed leaves in the folder, great. They don't get much attention
   taxonomically, though, due in large part to their inconstancy.

5. If you're collecting tissue for DNA work, the freshly-formed leaves at
   the end of the primocane are the best source. I had some bad experiences
   as a grad student, and so I collect enough for at least four
   extractions, and four flow cytometry analyses. Typically 50-100
   cm<sup>2</sup>. Double-bagged, with labels inside and out in case of
   catastrophe.

   ![Preparing a sample of *Rubus* leaf tissue for drying in

   full of orange silica crystals.")

   inside the ziplock bag with full of orange silica crystals. The inner
   bag is inside a larger ziplock, and a label is written on the bag in
   black marker, and on a paper slip visible inside the bag.")


6. Finally, make sure you note the habit of the plant for the label. The
   major growth forms include:

   * highbush blackberries, with upright, ascending, or somewhat arching stems
     that don't reach the ground and don't root at the tip
   * doming forms, that start out upright, but arch and may or may not root at
     the tips, possibly trailing along the ground as well
   * trailing forms, which may either grow prostrate on the ground, or trail
     and scramble over other low vegetation
    
   Do your best to describe what you see. It can be challenging to
   determine if you're looking at a trailing form, or a highbush form that
   is now growing on the ground after having been weighed down by snow or
   fallen branches. And some highbush species will look strange and
   stunted when growing in poor conditions.
            
The shape of the inflorescence should be visible on the sheet. The fruits,
however, will either rot or dry down to a pile of seeds. So definitely
include a note on their size (length and width). Also flavour, if you get
some ripe ones. Better in your belly, with a good description on the label,
than pressed into mash untasted!
            
Note that this protocol reflects the minimum necessary material for a
useful herbarium collection. If you have time and space for more than two
sheets, and you see interesting bits you'd like to include, you can always
collect more. Some of our collections include five or six sheets for a
single plant.
