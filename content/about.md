I am a botanist and conservation biologist. I work for Agriculture and Agrifood Canada, where I work on the systematics and diversity of uncultivated plants in agricultural systems. This includes crop wild relatives (especially small fruits: *Vaccinium*), weeds and invasive species.

This is my personal website, and the views expressed here are my own.
