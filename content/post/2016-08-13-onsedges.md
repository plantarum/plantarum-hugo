A few years ago I wrote a little webscraper to collect taxonomic treatments from the [Flora of North America](www.fna.org) website. There were a few problems with the last version, as the webpages on the FNA site have some inconsistencies that my code didn't handle. Checking the key against the list maintained by the [Natural Heritage Information Center](https://www.ontario.ca/page/get-natural-heritage-information), there were about 25 species missing, plus the entire genus _Cyperus_. I added the missing species, so the key should now be complete. It's available on my [botany page](http://plantarum.ca/botany/). The source files are available on my [bitbucket account](https://bitbucket.org/tws/onsedges).
